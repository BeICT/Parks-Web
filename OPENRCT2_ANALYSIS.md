# Parks Web - OpenRCT2 UX/UI Analysis & Implementation Plan

## OpenRCT2 Key UX/UI Features Analysis

Based on the OpenRCT2 documentation, here are the critical UX/UI features we need to implement:

### 1. **Top Toolbar Structure**
The main interface should have a comprehensive top toolbar with 4 groups:

**Group 1: Game Control**
- Pause/Play button
- Fast forward button (speed up time)
- File operations (save/load/options/quit)

**Group 2: View Options**
- Zoom in/out buttons
- Rotate view button
- View options (hide elements, underground view)
- Map button (minimap overview)

**Group 3: Construction Tools**
- Clear scenery tool
- Land modification tool
- Water tool
- Scenery placement tool
- Footpath tool
- New rides tool

**Group 4: Management**
- Finances window
- Research & development
- Rides list
- Park window
- Staff management
- Guest list

### 2. **Essential Game Systems**

**Path System**
- Footpaths for guest navigation
- Queue lines for rides
- Automatic path connections and junctions
- Bridge construction capabilities
- Drag-to-place functionality

**Shop & Stall System**
- Food & Drink stalls (satisfy hunger/thirst)
- Souvenir shops (increase happiness)
- Utility buildings (toilets, first aid, info kiosks, cash machines)
- Price management per item
- Park-wide pricing options

**Guest Needs System**
- Hunger, thirst, toilet needs
- Happiness and energy levels
- Weather-dependent preferences
- Guest pathfinding and AI

**Financial Management**
- Detailed income/expense tracking
- Loan system
- Marketing campaigns
- Ride pricing strategies

### 3. **Construction Interface**
- Modal windows for each construction type
- Preview system before placing
- Cost display before building
- Terrain modification tools
- Multi-level construction (bridges, underground)

### 4. **Information Systems**
- Real-time statistics tracking
- Guest feedback system
- Ride performance metrics
- Financial reports
- Research progress tracking

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core UI Framework ✅ (Completed)
- Basic menu system
- Game state management
- Event system
- Asset loading

### Phase 2: Essential Toolbar (Next Priority)
- Implement proper toolbar layout
- Add all construction tools
- Add view controls
- Add management buttons

### Phase 3: Construction Systems
- Path placement system
- Ride construction interface
- Shop placement system
- Terrain modification

### Phase 4: Guest & Management Systems
- Guest AI and needs
- Financial management
- Research system
- Staff management

### Phase 5: Polish & Advanced Features
- Minimap system
- Save/load functionality
- Sound effects
- Visual effects and animations

## Current Status vs OpenRCT2 Standards

### ✅ Currently Implemented:
- Basic 3D scene with camera controls
- Simple menu system
- Basic asset loading
- Procedural terrain generation

### ❌ Missing Critical Features:
- Proper toolbar interface
- Path construction system
- Shop/stall system
- Guest management
- Financial system
- Research system
- Proper UI windows and modals

## Next Steps

1. **Redesign the main UI** to match OpenRCT2's toolbar structure
2. **Implement path construction** as it's fundamental to gameplay
3. **Add shop system** for basic park economics
4. **Create proper UI windows** for management features
5. **Implement guest AI** for realistic park simulation

This analysis shows that while we have a good foundation, we need to significantly expand the UI and gameplay systems to match the RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 experience that players expect.
