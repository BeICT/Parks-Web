# Gameplay Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major gameplay improvements made to enhance the Park Tycoon game experience, focusing on better building mechanics, advanced AI, and proper in-game notifications.

## 1. Advanced Building System

### Grid-Based Construction
- **Grid System**: Implemented a 2x2 meter grid system for precise building placement
- **Path Management**: Paths can only be placed on the grid and cannot overlap
- **Ride Placement**: Rides require 2x2 grid spaces and must be connected to paths for guest access
- **Collision Detection**: Buildings cannot overlap and respect park boundaries

### BuildManager Class
**Location**: `src/game/BuildManager.ts`

**Key Features**:
- Grid-based validation for all building types
- Cost verification before construction
- Path connectivity requirements for rides
- Visual grid display when building tools are active
- Proper cleanup and refund system for demolition

**Building Types**:
- **Paths**: 1x1 grid, $50 cost, snap to grid
- **Rides**: 2x2 grid, $5,000-15,000 cost, require path access
- **Shops**: 1x1 grid, $2,000 cost, generate income
- **Decorations**: 1x1 grid, $200 cost, aesthetic value

### Visual Improvements
- **Build Grid**: Green overlay showing available build locations
- **Cursor Feedback**: Different cursors for different tools
- **Snapping**: All objects snap to grid for clean placement

## 2. Enhanced Visitor AI System

### Personality-Based Behavior
**Location**: `src/entities/Visitor.ts`

**Personality Types**:
1. **Thrill Seekers**: High patience for exciting rides, prefer roller coasters
2. **Family Friendly**: Medium patience, prefer safe rides like carousels
3. **Budget Conscious**: High patience but limited spending, seek value
4. **Explorers**: Variable patience, enjoy discovering new attractions

### Advanced Needs System
- **Hunger/Thirst**: Decay rates based on personality and age
- **Energy Management**: Affects ride choices and patience
- **Bathroom Needs**: Critical need that must be addressed
- **Fun Requirements**: Varies by personality type

### Intelligent Decision Making
- **Context-Aware Choices**: Visitors make decisions based on current needs
- **Complaint System**: Visitors generate specific complaints when unhappy
- **Weather Sensitivity**: Some visitors are more affected by weather
- **Group Behavior**: Visitors travel in groups of varying sizes

### Improved Pathfinding
- **Stuck Detection**: Automatic recovery when visitors get stuck
- **Target Selection**: Smart selection of destinations based on needs
- **Decision Cooldowns**: Realistic timing for decision-making

## 3. Professional Notification System

### In-Game Messages
**Location**: `src/ui/GameUI.ts`

**Message Types**:
- **Success** (Green): Successful actions like building completion
- **Error** (Red): Failed actions like insufficient funds
- **Warning** (Orange): Important alerts and cautions
- **Info** (Blue): General information and tips

### Visual Design
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, readable notifications with proper colors
- **Animation**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out effects
- **Positioning**: Centered at top of screen, non-intrusive
- **Duration Control**: Configurable display time based on importance

### Contextual Feedback
- **Building Feedback**: Specific messages for building success/failure
- **Cost Information**: Clear indication of costs and requirements
- **Validation Messages**: Helpful hints when building requirements aren't met

## 4. Enhanced Game Mechanics

### Economic Validation
- **Cost Checking**: Verify player has sufficient funds before building
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Different costs for different building types
- **Refund System**: Partial refunds when demolishing buildings

### Path Requirements
- **Accessibility**: Rides must be accessible via paths
- **Network Validation**: Ensure guests can reach attractions
- **Smart Placement**: Guidance for optimal building placement

### Grid Management
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized grid system for large parks
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Buildings must stay within park limits
- **Occupancy Tracking**: Accurate tracking of occupied vs. available spaces

## 5. Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Decision Throttling**: Visitors make decisions less frequently for better performance
- **Grid Caching**: Efficient grid state management
- **Visual Culling**: Grid visualization only when needed

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: BuildManager handles all building logic
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Clean communication between systems
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types for all game objects

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Failures**: Proper error handling and recovery
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages when things go wrong
- **State Consistency**: Maintain consistent game state

## 6. User Experience Enhancements

### Visual Feedback
- **Build Grid**: Shows available building locations
- **Cursor Changes**: Visual indication of selected tool
- **Color Coding**: Clear visual distinction between message types

### Intuitive Controls
- **Tool Selection**: Easy switching between building tools
- **Click-to-Build**: Simple click interface for construction
- **Validation**: Immediate feedback on building viability

### Professional Polish
- **No Browser Alerts**: All notifications are in-game
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the overall game aesthetic
- **Responsive Design**: Works well at different screen sizes

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Additions
1. **Advanced Pathfinding**: A* algorithm for optimal visitor routing
2. **Terrain Modification**: Ability to modify landscape height
3. **Custom Ride Designer**: Tools for creating unique attractions
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed visitor behavior tracking
5. **Seasonal Events**: Special events and challenges
6. **Multiplayer Features**: Competitive or cooperative gameplay

### Technical Debt
1. **Performance Profiling**: Optimize for larger parks
2. **Save/Load System**: Persistent game state
3. **Asset Streaming**: Load assets on demand
4. **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly controls

## Conclusion

These improvements transform the basic building system into a professional, grid-based construction system with intelligent AI and proper user feedback. The game now provides a much more polished and engaging experience with:

- **Precise Building Control**: Grid-based system prevents messy layouts
